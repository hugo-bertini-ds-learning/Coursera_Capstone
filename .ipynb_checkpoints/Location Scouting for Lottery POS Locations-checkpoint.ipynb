    "**The Goal**   \n",
    "\n",
    "Find the adequate locations for a new Lottery POS.   \n",
    "This is one way of assisting the Commercial Network Managers in the decision of selecting a new location or of assessing whether a proposal for a new POS is suitable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**   \n",
    "\n",
    "The Lottery business strongly relies on the proximity with their audience. And this proximity happens at many different levels and manners, especially because it is usually an activity operated by a minimal number of entities, and is significantly controlled by Governments.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this activity will typically bring benefit social causes which in turn take care of those in need.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it is important for the Lottery operators and the Society to ensure that although the level of commercial activity is kept in good health, the responsible gaming criteria is also met.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this _paper_ I study a number of information sources with the hope of establishing a reasonable set of criteria that would increase the odds of the Lottery activity growing within the responsible gaming figure.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The main aspect that will be in focus herein is the location of a new POS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Social levels/tiers of each area are not considered in this study, as this information is really hard to gather as a freelance investigator. So we will rather give higher consideration for areas where the commercial activity is greater."

    "1. **Foursquare venue** information\n",

    "1. **Google's mobility** data\n",
    "    - This information will provide a better idea of the mobility per location.\n",
    "1. **Existing Lottery POS location** information from a provider's website\n",

    "   - I will use a subset of the geoJSON data, just as enough as to represent the Districts and boroughs being studied.   \n",
    "1. **Foursquare venue** information   \n",
    "   - The information about venues will be grabbed from the Foursquare API. \n",
    "   - The information of interest is about trends, likes, categories, similarity and details.\n",
    "1. **Google's mobility data**\n",
    "   - The information of interest is about Transit stations, Retail & recreation, Residential and Workplaces.\n",
    "   - The data is formatted in a pre-COVID-19 vs COVID-19 _era_ manner, so this will be taken into account.\n",
    "1. **Existing Lottery POS** information in Portugal from the provider's website\n",
    "   - I will perform a manual crawl on the publicly available webpage of [SCML](https://www.djogos.scml.pt/web/SCMediador/verMediadores) for the intended District. I decided on a manual approach as it is much less worky than puting the automated web crawling technologies into practice for this one District. Should a national coverage be required, I would consider asking the provider for the information or implementing an automated crawl.    \n",
    "   - The information of interest is POS name (which will be obfuscated during the process and prior to analysis), address and postal code.   \n",
    "   - We will use the address and postal code to obtain the best coordinates possible.\n",
